<h1>Balabrok (Upgraded Balatro)</h1>
<h5>This is a personal recreation of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/">Balatro</a>, a poker-inspired roguelike deck builder all about creating powerful synergies with cards, hand types and Jokers.</h5>
<h5>When I was making this game, I was thinking about redisignig it's dimensions, make it bigger, 'cause the game is incredible, and I wanted to do more. So I bagun making it, and I'll try expand the concepts of this game and make it even crazier!</h5>
<h5>Without <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=LocalThunk">LocalThunk</a>, this project wouldn't exist (Just to pay repects).</h5>
